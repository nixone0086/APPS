Hello there!
This repository contains my solutions for the APPS (Architecture of Parallel Computing Systems) course assignments. I’ve decided to make this code public primarily for educational purposes.

I believe that seeing different ways to solve a problem is a great way to learn, so feel free to use these materials as a reference, a study guide, or a way to compare your own logic with mine. Whether you're stuck on a specific Assembly module or curious about CUDA implementations, I hope you find these examples helpful.

A small request: Please use this repository responsibly. It's meant to help you understand the concepts, not for direct copying. The real value comes from figuring out the "how" and "why" behind the code!

Good luck with your studies!
